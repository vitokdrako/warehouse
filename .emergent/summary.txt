<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to finalize the Damage-to-Archive workflow. This quickly expanded into a series of major UI/UX refactors and bug fixes across the application.

1.  **Complete Damage Workflow:** Finish and test the flow where a damage fee from an order automatically appears in the finance console, allows for payment, and enables the order to be archived.
2.  **Fix Critical Bugs:** Resolve issues preventing damage payments from being processed and customer deposits from being refunded.
3.  **Enhance Financial UI:** Add a visual indicator (badge) to the main order list in the finance console to show which orders have outstanding damage fees.
4.  **Overhaul Damage Hub:** Completely redesign the . The new design should list orders with damages, show detailed items for a selected order, and allow managers to send specific items for Washing, Restoration, or Dry-cleaning. This action should lock the item and update its status.
5.  **Dashboard UI Cleanup:** Move the Archive button on the manager dashboard to the main navigation header and remove the On Restoration KPI card for a cleaner layout.
6.  **Apply Corporate Branding:** Implement a consistent corporate visual style (based on ) across the , , and  pages. This includes applying specific colors, fonts, and layouts, and removing emojis from UI elements.

        3.  Review the changes in  to ensure no infinite loops or inefficient rendering patterns were introduced.
        4.  Test the primary API endpoint for the catalog () using  to isolate whether the slowdown is in the backend or frontend.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The catalog is a core feature of the application. It must be functional and performant for users to browse and manage products.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both. First, confirm the API is fast, then confirm the frontend loads quickly and looks correct.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: (P0) Finalize and verify the corporate styling of the Catalog page.**
    -   **Where to resume:** Begin with the debugging checklist for Issue 1 to resolve the performance problem.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the user's request for a consistent brand identity across all major application pages.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (visual verification).
    -   **Blocked on something:** Issue 1: Catalog page is slow/timing out.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   (P1) **Implement Backend for Expenses:** The  tab in  is currently frontend-only. The backend needs to be built to support , , , and  persistence.
