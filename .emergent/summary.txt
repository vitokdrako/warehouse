<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to continue development based on a prioritized list from a previous session. The top priorities were:
1.  **(P0) Laundry Management System:** Implement a new module to track textiles sent to dry cleaners.
2.  **(P1) Mobile Adaptation:** Make the entire application mobile-friendly.
3.  **(P2) User Tracking:** Complete the implementation of user action tracking (audit trail).
4.  **(P3) Internal Notes System:** Finalize the internal notes feature.
5.  **(P4) Event Tool Integration:** Continue with the integration of an Event Tool.

During the session, the user added new requirements:
-   **Corporate Styling:** Apply a consistent corporate design (colors, fonts, layout) across the entire application, based on styles from the user's other projects ().
-   **Production Build:** After completing the styling and features, compile and package the frontend and backend files for deployment on the user's own production servers, configuring the frontend to point to the correct production backend URL.

**User's preferred language**: українська

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack rental management system (React/FastAPI/MySQL). During this session, several major features and changes were completed:
-   **Laundry Management System:** A complete module for tracking textile batches sent to dry cleaners was implemented. This includes a backend API () for all CRUD operations and a dedicated frontend page () to manage the workflow.
-   **Corporate Design System:** A new, unified corporate style has been applied across the entire application. This involved creating a new stylesheet (), updating the Tailwind configuration with corporate colors, and refactoring all major pages and components (, , , , , etc.) to match the new design.
-   **Full Mobile Adaptation:** The application is now fully responsive and mobile-friendly. The  component has been enhanced, and responsive styles have been applied globally.
-   **Production Build Ready:** A deployment-ready package has been created in . It contains the complete backend source code and the compiled frontend  directory, which is correctly configured to point to the user's production backend URL ().

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent's final task was to create a production-ready build for the user to deploy on their own servers. The user pointed out that the first build was incorrectly pointing to the test environment's backend. The agent corrected this by updating the  in , rebuilding the frontend, and packaging the correct files into the  directory.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** NA (User will deploy and test on their own infrastructure).
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: (P0) Complete and Verify User Action Tracking.**
-   **Issue 2: (P1) Verify and Finalize Internal Notes System.**
-   **Issue 3: (P2) Verify Event Tool Integration Workflow.**

Issues Detail:
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description:** (P0) The agent began adding user ID capture (, ) to backend endpoints but the implementation was rushed and incomplete. Many  operations failed, indicating that the logic was not applied consistently. The entire user tracking system needs a thorough review to ensure every relevant action in , , , etc., correctly records the user who performed it.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent added user tracking logic to some functions in  and .
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Thoroughly review the document .
        2.  Systematically go through every , , , and  endpoint in all route files (, , , ).
        3.  Ensure that  is called and the returned  is saved to the appropriate column (, , , etc.) for every database modification.
        4.  Pay special attention to endpoints where previous edit attempts failed.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical business requirement for accountability, providing a complete audit trail of all actions performed in the system.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS

    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.
-   **Issue 2:**
    -   **Description:** (P1) The  component was updated with the new corporate style, but the end-to-end functionality was not verified after the recent backend changes. It also needs to be confirmed that this component is integrated into all relevant parts of the application (e.g., Issue Cards, Return Cards).
    -   **Attempted fixes:** Applied corporate styles to the component.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Test creating, viewing, and deleting notes on an order.
        2.  Verify that the user who created the note is correctly recorded and displayed.
        3.  Check all relevant pages (, , ) and ensure the  component is present and functional.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To enable clear internal communication among team members, a key requirement from the user's SOPs.
    -   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
